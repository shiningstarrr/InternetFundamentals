# Network devices
- Host
    âœ« Host is any device which send or receive traffic
    âœ« Clients initiat requests, Servers respond.
    âœ« Hosts on a network share the same IP address space
- IP Address
    âœ« IP Address is the identity of the host.
- Network
    âœ« Network is what transports traffic between Hosts
    âœ« Grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity
- Repeater
    âœ« Data crossing a wire decays as it travels
    âœ« Repeaters regenerate signals which allow communications across greater distances.
- Hub: 
    âœ« Hubs are multi-port Repeaters 
    âœ« Facilitates scaling communication between additional hosts
    âœ« Everyone receives everyone else's data
- Bridge
    âœ« Bridges sit between Hub-connected hosts
    âœ« Bridges only have two ports
    âœ« Bridges learn which hosts are on each side
- Switch
    âœ« Swiches facilitate communication within a network
    âœ« Switches are a combination of Hubs and Bridges
    âœ« Multiple ports
    âœ« Learn which hosts are on each port
- Router
    âœ« Router facilitate communication between networks
    âœ« Provide traffic control points(security, filtering, redirecting)
    âœ« Routers learn(have IP address) which networks they are attached to, and they ar stored in a routing table.
- Routing is the process of moving data between network, switching is the process of moving data within networks.
- Subnet Mask: segregates an IP address into network bits that identify the network and host bits. Ex: 2555.255.255.0 or /24
- DNS: A protocol which converts a Domain Name into an IP address. Example: www.PracticalNetworking.net -> 192.249.124.38
# OSI Model
- OSI Reference Model: 
    layer 1 - Pysical - Transporting Bits
        Â° Computer data exists in the form of Bits (1's and 0's)
        Â° Something has to transport those bits between hosts
        Â° L1 technologies: Cables, Wifi, Repeater
    layer 2 - Data Link - Hop to Hop
        Â° Interacts with the Wire: i.e.Network Interface Cards, Wifi access cards.
        Â° Addressing Scheme - MAC addresses: 48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits.
        Â° L2 technologies: NICs, Switches
        Â° Often communication between hosts require multiple hops.
    layer 3 - Network - End to End
        Â° Addressing Scheme - IP adresses: 32 bits
        Â° L3 technologies: Routers, Hosts
        Â° ARP: Address Resolution Protocol: links a L3 address to a L2 address.
    layer 4 - Transport - Service to Service
        Â° Distinguish data streams
        Â° Addressing Scheme - Ports: 0-65535 - TCP (favors reliability), 0-65535 - UDP (favors efficiency)
        Â° Servers listen for requests to pre-defined Ports
        Â° Clients select random Port for each connection: Response traffic will arrive on this port. For all connections, always a source port and destination port involved.
        Â° About Port number: https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/port-number
    layer 5 - Session, layer 6 - Presentation, layer 7 - Application
        Â° Other Networking Models combine these into one layer - Application
- Purpose of Networking: Allow two hosts to share data with one another.

# Everything Hosts do to speak on the internet
- Scenario 1: Hosts connected directly to each other(on the same network):
    1. Both hosts have a NIC, and therefore a MAC address
    2. Both hosts are configured with an IP address and a Subnet Mask
    3. Host A has some Data to send to Host B
    4. Host A knows the IP address of Host B, so Host A can create the L3 header to attach to the Data
    5. Host A does not know Host B's MAC address: Host A must use Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)
        âž¢ ARP Request asks for the MAC address associated with target IP
            a. ARP Request includes sender's MAC address
            b. ARP Request is a broadcast-sent to everyone on the network: destination MAC address: ffff.ffff.ffff, and reserved MAC address to send a packet to everyone on the local network
        âž¢ ARP IP/MAC Mappings are stored in an ARP Cache
        âž¢ Host B responds by sending an ARP Response(include B's MAC and IP address)
        âž¢ Host A populates it's ARP cache with Host B's IP/MAC mapping
    6. Host A uses ARP to resolve target's MAC address, and creates L2 header
    7. Data is sent to Host B (Data->L3->L2)
        âž¢ L2 header is discarded
        âž¢ L3 header is discarded
        âž¢ Data is processed by Application
- Scenario 2: Host connected through a Router(in a foreign network):
    1. Host A, Host C, and the Router have MAC and IP addresses
    2. Host A has some data to send to Host C
        âž¢ Host A knows Host C's IP address which provided by the User or the Application
        âž¢ Host A knows Host C's IP address is on a foreign network
    3. Host A creates a L3 header: Layer 3 - end to end
    4. Host A needs to create a L2 header: Layer 2- hop to hop
    5. Host A uses ARP to resolve the MAC address of the Router's IP
        âž¢ Router IP address is configured as the Default Gateway
    6. Host A creats L2 header: layer 2 and Data is sent to the Router
        âž¢ L2 header is discarded
        âž¢ Router takes over from this point
        âž¢ Host A's job is done
    7. ARP mapping can be used for any host in foreign networks
    8. Host A's first step when sending data is always the same: determine if target IP is on local or foreign network
        âž¢ foreign - ARP for Default Gateway IP
        âž¢ Local - ARP for Target IP

# Everything Switches do to facilitate communication
- Switching is the process of moving data within network, and devices communicating through a switch belong to the same IP network.
- Switches are L2 devices - they only use L2 header to make decisions
- Switches use and maintain MAC Address Table: Mapping of Switch Ports to MAC address
- Switches perform three actions: 
    âž¢ Learn: Update MAC Address Table with mapping of switch ports to Source MAC
    âž¢ Flood: Duplicate and send frame out all swtich ports (except receiving port)
    âž¢ Forward: Use MAC Address Table to deliver Frame to appropriate switch port
- Process would be identical if Host D was a Router connected to the internet
- Traffic going through the switch
    âž¢ Switch has a MAC address and is configured with an IP address
    âž¢ Switch essentially acts as a host in the network
- Unicast Frame vs Broadcast Frame:
    âž¢ Unicast Frame - destination MAC address is a host: Switch will flood only if MAC address in not in the table
    âž¢ Broadcast Frame - destination MAC address of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF: always Flooded
- VLANs - Virtual Local Area Networks
    âž¢ Divides Switch Ports into isolated groups
    âž¢ Divides Switches into multiple "mini-switches"
    âž¢ Switches do all three actions within each VLAN
- Multiple Switches:
    âž¢ Switches maintain independent MAC address Tables
    âž¢ Switches perform switch actions indepently

# Everything Routers do to facilitate communication
- RFC: Internet Protocol
- Routers are connected to a network and have an IP address and a MAC address.
- Routers forward packets not destined to themselves.
- Routers maintain a map of all the Networks they know about
    âž¢ Routing Table can be populated via three methods:
        1. Directly Connected - Routes for the Networks which are attached
        2. Static Routes - Routes manuelly provided by an Administrator
        3. Dynamic Routes - Routes learned automatically from other routers
- Routers also have ARP Table - mapping of L3 to L2 address
    âž¢ Everything with an IP address has an ARP Table
    âž¢ Start Empty - populated as needed with network traffic
- Complete process of sending data between Host A and Host C:
    1. Host A has data to send to Host C, and constructs the L3 header.
    2. Host A knows packet must be sent to Default Gateway(R1)
    3. Host A cannot construct L2 header since no ARP entry for Gateway's IP address(R1)
    4. Host A sends ARP Request for 10.0.44.1
    5. R1 populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.44.9
    6. R1 sends ARP Response
    7. Host populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.44.1
    8. Host A constructs L2 header. Host A send packet to R1.
    9. Router1 receives packet. R1 discards L2 header.
    10. R1 look up Destination IP in Routing Table
        âž¢ Packet's next hop is to 10.0.55.2
    11. R1 cannot construct L2 header
    12. R1 sends ARP Request for 10.0.55.2
    13. R2 populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.55.1
    14. R2 sends ARP Response. R1 populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.55.2
    15. R1 constructs L2 header. R1 sends packet to R2
    16. R2 receives packet. R2 discards L2 header. R2 looks up Destination in Routing Table and find the final hop.
    17. R2 cannot construct L2 header since No ARP entry for 10.0.66.7. R2 sends ARP Request for 10.0.66.7.
    18. Host C populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.66.7. Host C sends ARP Response. R2 populates its ARP Table with entry for 10.0.66.7
    19. Host C receives packet. Host C discards L2 header. Host C discards L3 header. Host C processes data.

# Network Protocols - ARP, FTP, SMTP, HTTP, SSL, TSL, HTTPS, DNS, DHCP

    âž¢ DNS Server IP(s) - Translate domain name into IP Address

# Packages traveling: Host, Router, Switch, Router, Router, Host
- Data moves through networks based upon three tables:
    âž¢ MAC Address Table - Mapping of Switch Port to MAC Address
    âž¢ ARP Table/Cache - Mapping of IP address to MAC address
    âž¢ Routing Table - Mapping of IP Network to Interface or Next Router
