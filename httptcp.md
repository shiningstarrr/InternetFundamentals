# Network devices
- Host
    âœ« Host is any device which send or receive traffic
    âœ« Clients initiat requests, Servers respond.
    âœ« Hosts on a network share the same IP address space
- IP Address
    âœ« IP Address is the identity of the host.
- Network
    âœ« Network is what transports traffic between Hosts
    âœ« Grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity
- Repeater
    âœ« Data crossing a wire decays as it travels
    âœ« Repeaters regenerate signals which allow communications across greater distances.
- Hub: 
    âœ« Hubs are multi-port Repeaters 
    âœ« Facilitates scaling communication between additional hosts
    âœ« Everyone receives everyone else's data
- Bridge
    âœ« Bridges sit between Hub-connected hosts
    âœ« Bridges only have two ports
    âœ« Bridges learn which hosts are on each side
- Switch
    âœ« Swiches facilitate communication within a network
    âœ« Switches are a combination of Hubs and Bridges
    âœ« Multiple ports
    âœ« Learn which hosts are on each port
- Router
    âœ« Router facilitate communication between networks
    âœ« Provide traffic control points(security, filtering, redirecting)
    âœ« Routers learn(have IP address) which networks they are attached to, and they ar stored in a routing table.
- Routing is the process of moving data between network, switching is the process of moving data within networks.
- Subnet Mask: segregates an IP address into network bits that identify the network and host bits. Ex: 2555.255.255.0 or /24
- DNS: A protocol which converts a Domain Name into an IP address. Example: www.PracticalNetworking.net -> 192.249.124.38
# OSI Model
- OSI Reference Model: 
    layer 1 - Pysical - Transporting Bits
        Â° Computer data exists in the form of Bits (1's and 0's)
        Â° Something has to transport those bits between hosts
        Â° L1 technologies: Cables, Wifi, Repeater
    layer 2 - Data Link - Hop to Hop
        Â° Interacts with the Wire: i.e.Network Interface Cards, Wifi access cards.
        Â° Addressing Scheme - MAC addresses: 48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits.
        Â° L2 technologies: NICs, Switches
        Â° Often communication between hosts require multiple hops.
    layer 3 - Network - End to End
        Â° Addressing Scheme - IP adresses: 32 bits
        Â° L3 technologies: Routers, Hosts
        Â° ARP: Address Resolution Protocol: links a L3 address to a L2 address.
    layer 4 - Transport - Service to Service
        Â° Distinguish data streams
        Â° Addressing Scheme - Ports: 0-65535 - TCP (favors reliability), 0-65535 - UDP (favors efficiency)
        Â° Servers listen for requests to pre-defined Ports
        Â° Clients select random Port for each connection: Response traffic will arrive on this port. For all connections, always a source port and destination port involved.
        Â° About Port number: https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/port-number
    layer 5 - Session, layer 6 - Presentation, layer 7 - Application
        Â° Other Networking Models combine these into one layer - Application
- Purpose of Networking: Allow two hosts to share data with one another.

# Everything Hosts do to speak on the internet
- Scenario 1: Hosts connected directly to each other(on the same network):
    1. Both hosts have a NIC, and therefore a MAC address
    2. Both hosts are configured with an IP address and a Subnet Mask
    3. Host A has some Data to send to Host B
    4. Host A knows the IP address of Host B, so Host A can create the L3 header to attach to the Data
    5. Host A does not know Host B's MAC address: Host A must use Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)
        âž¢ ARP Request asks for the MAC address associated with target IP
            a. ARP Request includes sender's MAC address
            b. ARP Request is a broadcast-sent to everyone on the network: destination MAC address: ffff.ffff.ffff, and reserved MAC address to send a packet to everyone on the local network
        âž¢ ARP IP/MAC Mappings are stored in an ARP Cache
        âž¢ Host B responds by sending an ARP Response(include B's MAC and IP address)
        âž¢ Host A populates it's ARP cache with Host B's IP/MAC mapping
    6. Host A uses ARP to resolve target's MAC address, and creates L2 header
    7. Data is sent to Host B (Data->L3->L2)
        âž¢ L2 header is discarded
        âž¢ L3 header is discarded
        âž¢ Data is processed by Application
- Scenario 2: Host connected through a Router(in a foreign network):
    1. Host A, Host C, and the Router have MAC and IP addresses
    2. Host A has some data to send to Host C
        âž¢ Host A knows Host C's IP address which provided by the User or the Application
        âž¢ Host A knows Host C's IP address is on a foreign network
    3. Host A creates a L3 header: Layer 3 - end to end
    4. Host A needs to create a L2 header: Layer 2- hop to hop
    5. Host A uses ARP to resolve the MAC address of the Router's IP
        âž¢ Router IP address is configured as the Default Gateway
    6. Host A creats L2 header: layer 2 and Data is sent to the Router
        âž¢ L2 header is discarded
        âž¢ Router takes over from this point
        âž¢ Host A's job is done
    7. ARP mapping can be used for any host in foreign networks
    8. Host A's first step when sending data is always the same: determine if target IP is on local or foreign network
        âž¢ foreign - ARP for Default Gateway IP
        âž¢ Local - ARP for Target IP

# Everything Switches do to facilitate communication
- Switching is the process of moving data within network, and devices communicating through a switch belong to the same IP network.
- Switches are L2 devices - they only use L2 header to make decisions
- Switches use and maintain MAC Address Table: Mapping of Switch Ports to MAC address
- Switches perform three actions: 
    âž¢ Learn: Update MAC Address Table with mapping of switch ports to Source MAC
    âž¢ Flood: Duplicate and send frame out all swtich ports (except receiving port)
    âž¢ Forward: Use MAC Address Table to deliver Frame to appropriate switch port
- Process would be identical if Host D was a Router connected to the internet
- Traffic going through the switch
    âž¢ Switch has a MAC address and is configured with an IP address
    âž¢ Switch essentially acts as a host in the network

# Everything Routers do to facilitate communication
- Unicast Frame vs Broadcast Frame:
    âž¢ Unicast Frame - destination MAC address is a host: Switch will flood only if MAC address in not in the table
    âž¢ Broadcast Frame - destination MAC address of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF: always Flooded
- VLANs - Virtual Local Area Networks
    âž¢ Divides Switch Ports into isolated groups
    âž¢ Divides Switches into multiple "mini-switches"
    âž¢ Switches do all three actions within each VLAN
- Multiple Switches:
    âž¢ Switches maintain independent MAC address Tables
    âž¢ Switches perform switch actions indepently
